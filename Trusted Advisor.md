## üöÄ About Us
üë©‚Äçüíª **Ella Owens**


Hi! I am currently a cyber security fellow, in the TKH Innovation Fellowship, learning the principles of cybersecurity and preforming security operation and optimization for security functions in AWS cloud. I have participated in a collaborative team to demonstrate an understanding and application of AWS services for building a secure lab in the AWS Cloud environment. The project involved leveraging AWS services to create a secure infrastructure that can protect against various cyber threats and attacks. For the final months of this cyber security fellowship, I am joining other students to create a capstone project. GitHub allows us to document our work while demonstrating our understanding of what we have learned and continue to learn.
