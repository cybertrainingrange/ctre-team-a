AWS Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is a cloud-based object storage service that stores, retrieves, and secures any amount of data and any type of file from anywhere. Amazon S3 is recognized for its flexibility, availability, durability, and scalability. S3 has a 99.99% level of durability and scalability.  S3‚Äôs durability allows one to store and protect data. The data can be stored in different regions and multiple devices, which can always be available when needed. S3 is intended to scale the user‚Äôs storage needs thus allowing any amount of data to be stored. S3 is also able to retrieve and store data such as images, documents, videos, and application data. Amazon S3 is extremely flexible as it can be used with other services within AWS such as Amazon Lambda, Amazon RDS, and Amazon EC2. This flexibility creates a comprehensive solution for constructing and using cloud applications.
 
Overall, S3 can backup data, be used as a storage, host software applications, configure static websites to run from an S3 bucket, and build infrastructure that can host photos, videos, or even uploads and downloads. Its ease of use makes it an ideal storage solution for many applications.

## üöÄ About Us
üë©‚Äçüíª **Ella Owens**


Hi! I am currently a cyber security fellow, in the TKH Innovation Fellowship, learning the principles of cybersecurity and preforming security operation and optimization for security functions in AWS cloud. I have participated in a collaborative team to demonstrate an understanding and application of AWS services for building a secure lab in the AWS Cloud environment. The project involved leveraging AWS services to create a secure infrastructure that can protect against various cyber threats and attacks. For the final months of this cyber security fellowship, I am joining other students to create a capstone project. GitHub allows us to document our work while demonstrating our understanding of what we have learned and continue to learn.
