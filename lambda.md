| AWS Lambda is a compute service that operates without the need for servers. It executes your code when specific events occur and takes care of managing the underlying computing resources. These events can encompass various changes in state, such as a user adding an item to a shopping cart on an online store. By utilizing AWS Lambda, you can add customized logic to enhance other AWS services or develop your own backend services that operate at the same scale, performance, and security level as AWS itself. AWS Lambda autonomously executes code in response to different types of events, such as HTTP requests through Amazon API Gateway, modifications to objects in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets, updates to tables in Amazon DynamoDB, and state transitions in AWS Step Functions.
Lambda runs your code on resilient computing infrastructure and takes care of all administrative tasks related to your computing resources. This includes maintenance of servers and operating systems, provisioning and scaling of capacity as needed, deployment of code and security patches, and monitoring and logging of your code. Your responsibility is simply to provide the code. |

 ## How does Lambda function? 
| **Trigger:** A Lambda function is triggered by an event. The event can come from various sources, such as an HTTP request, changes to data in an AWS service (e.g., S3, DynamoDB), or a scheduled time-based trigger.
**Function Execution:** When the event occurs, AWS Lambda automatically provisions the necessary compute resources and executes the corresponding Lambda function. Each function is independent and isolated from other functions, ensuring scalability and security.
**Code Execution:** The Lambda function executes the code you have provided in the chosen runtime environment (e.g., Node.js, Python, Java). It performs the necessary operations based on the event and any additional input or context provided.
**Compute Resources:** AWS Lambda manages the underlying compute resources required to execute your code. It dynamically scales the resources based on the incoming workload, ensuring high availability and efficient resource utilization.
**Response:** Once the code execution is complete, Lambda returns the response to the triggering source or performs any specified actions. For example, it can return an HTTP response, update data in a database, or trigger subsequent Lambda functions. |

### Benefits of using Lambda:

**Cost-effectiveness:** Lambda allows you to pay only for the compute time that you consume. This can result in significant cost savings, especially if you have irregular traffic patterns. 

- You only pay for the Lambda functions that you use, so you can save money on infrastructure costs.

**Scalability:** Lambda automatically scales your application based on the number of requests it receives. This means that you don't have to worry about provisioning or managing servers.

**Simplified deployment:** With Lambda, you can deploy your code in seconds. This means that you can iterate and test your application more quickly.

**High availability:** Lambda is designed to be highly available and fault-tolerant. This means that your application can handle failures without any downtime or disruption to your users.

**Monitoring:** AWS Lambda provides monitoring tools such as Amazon CloudWatch, which allows you to monitor the performance and health of your Lambda functions in real-time. This helps you detect and troubleshoot issues quickly.
